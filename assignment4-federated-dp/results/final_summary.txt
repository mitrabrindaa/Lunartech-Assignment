FEDERATED LEARNING WITH DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY - FINAL REPORT

=== PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ===
Centralized LR:     0.9825
Centralized RF:     0.9561
Federated Learning: 0.9737 (-0.88%)
DP-FL:             0.9474 (-3.51%)

=== KEY INSIGHTS ===
1. Federated learning successfully maintains 97.4% of centralized performance
2. Differential privacy adds 2.63% accuracy cost but ensures strong privacy
3. Non-IID hospital distributions handled effectively
4. Communication efficiency achieved in 10 rounds

=== CONCLUSION ===
The implementation demonstrates that federated learning with differential privacy
is viable for healthcare applications, providing a good balance between model
performance and patient privacy protection.
